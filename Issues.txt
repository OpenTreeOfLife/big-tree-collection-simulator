Tree parsing:
    Internal labels need to occur after the subtree description:
        ((A,B)internal,C); not (internal(A,B),C);
    but the handling of adding quoted labels allows the pre-subtree name:
        ((A,B)'internal',C); and ('internal'(A,B),C); are both accepted
    See accepted_internal.newick   accepted_internal2.newick  
        accepted_internal3.newick  accepted_nointernal.newick and
        rejected_internal.newick
    in the test subdir.

Labeling:
If you have duplicate labels in the taxonomy a suffix like "_DUPLICATE#", where
# is a unique number, will be added to the label. This may mean that the taxon
name listed in the WEIGHTS file matches a different taxon than you anticipated.

Weighting:
Using weight differences so large that the result in rounding error. A presample
step verifies that there are enough leaves in the selected subtree to satisfy
the requested SAMPLE. But if some have a very low probability of being selected,
the random number generation/choice algorithm may never return them.

Name:
"big-tree-sim" is a lame name. Plus it is more of a tree tweaker than a 
de-novo simulator.  I'm open to suggestions.
